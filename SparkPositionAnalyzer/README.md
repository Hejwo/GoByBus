Algorythms

#### 1. Find terminus
* Take whole line data from a current day (ideally day before)
* Join it in TramFrames
* Join Frames with zero speed next to each other in one
* Find biggest delays (fixed time will be good for start)
* Find approx area of terminus
* Try to store it somehow (?).   
Here will start part of building images and Lambda architecture I guess.

#### 2. Find single course
* Read found starting point
* Read end point
